						***** Second-Hand Book Selling system *****

We all know colleges, schools, and tuition fees are out of control, but there’s one expense that we all may not discover 
until it’s too late. We are talking about the high cost of school textbooks — the books we’re technically required to purchase and 
bring to class.
Used book shopping has been the latest thing in the present stream. The way toward selling and purchasing the used book is by 
one way or another leading to time and energy wastage. The motivation behind this paper is to give arrangement through Online
Second-hand Bookshop System. The client section incorporates purchaser, dealer, and donator. A web bookstore is nothing but a 
virtual store on the web where customers can browse the catalog and select books of interest. Users can select many books and
those books are stored in a cart. At checkout, the things within the handcart are going to be presented as an order. 
Usually, the customer will be asked to fill in the essential details or select a billing address, a shipping address, a shipping option, 
and payment information such as a credit/debit card number.

Our proposed model will be proven to be appropriate for students or users by providing benefits such that they can get their 
book delivered instead of actually going and buying the book.

Introduction:

This project is based on online secondhand book buying & selling management system. People have many course based literature text books and novels etc that they have stopped reading and these books are 
laying on their book shelves unused. These books can be used by another person who currently has a need. This website will not only serve students but can also help people who need older books which 
currently are not available in market or sold at higher price. In this project we have used Python Django as our Backend, Bootstrap as a frontend and sqlite as a database.

In the bookstore main page we have created a navigation bar and a carousel, in the navigation bar itself we hav e four buttons such as home, user, sign up and login. A customer can sign up from the main
 page using the sign up button which is connected to the database, If a customers has already registerd with the site they can login from the main page using login button. After signing up  acustomer can 
 buy their desired books and request for new books. After selecting the book a customer can checkout from the billing section by using the cart function. There is a admin login as well where admin can see 
 and make changes to the book and look into the requested book and database itself.
