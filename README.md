						***** Second-Hand Book Selling system *****

We all know colleges, schools, and tuition fees are out of control, but there’s one expense that we all may not discover 
until it’s too late. We are talking about the high cost of school textbooks — the books we’re technically required to purchase and 
bring to class.
Used book shopping has been the latest thing in the present stream. The way toward selling and purchasing the used book is by 
one way or another leading to time and energy wastage. The motivation behind this paper is to give arrangement through Online
Second-hand Bookshop System. The client section incorporates purchaser, dealer, and donator. A web bookstore is nothing but a 
virtual store on the web where customers can browse the catalog and select books of interest. Users can select many books and
those books are stored in a cart. At checkout, the things within the handcart are going to be presented as an order. 
Usually, the customer will be asked to fill in the essential details or select a billing address, a shipping address, a shipping option, 
and payment information such as a credit/debit card number.

Our proposed model will be proven to be appropriate for students or users by providing benefits such that they can get their 
book delivered instead of actually going and buying the book.
